# PPTA-DR3
Collection of data, analysis codes, and mcmc chains from the data release and analysis of the PPTA third data release. This is a public copy of the repository provided to the International Pulsar Timing Array (IPTA) to begin data combination efforts. It excludes the singularity image entpptadr3_bilby_nano.sif, pulsar pickle object, and a large free spectrum mcmc chain file because of size limitations. These and other files will be available on the CSIRO data access portal.
